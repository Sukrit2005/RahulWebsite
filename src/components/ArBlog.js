              <p className="wax-intro-text">
                Allergic rhinitis is a prevalent condition, affecting millions
                worldwide. Characterized by inflammation of the nasal passages
                due to exposure to allergens, allergic rhinitis significantly
                impacts the quality of life for those affected. This blog aims
                to delve into the causes, symptoms, and management strategies
                for allergic rhinitis without going into much details.

              <p className="wax-intro-text">
                Allergic rhinitis occurs when the immune system overreacts to
                allergens such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or mold
                spores. Upon exposure to these allergens, the body's immune
                system releases histamines and other chemicals, leading to
                inflammation of the nasal passages and triggering symptoms.

                  effective in reducing inflammation and congestion when used
                  regularly.

                  shots (immunotherapy) may be recommended. Allergy shots work
                  by gradually desensitizing the immune system to specific
                  allergens, reducing the severity of allergic reactions over
                  time.

                  : In addition to medication, lifestyle modifications can
                  further aid in managing allergic rhinitis. Keeping windows
                  closed during high pollen seasons, wearing sunglasses to
                  protect the eyes from allergens, and avoiding outdoor
                  activities on windy days can help minimize exposure to
                  allergens.
