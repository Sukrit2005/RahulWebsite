              <p className="wax-intro-text">
                Endoscopy is a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic tool used in
                Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) to visualize and assess various
                structures within the head and neck region. There are several
                types of endoscopic procedures performed by ENT specialists,
                each serving specific purposes and addressing different
                conditions. Below are some common types of endoscopies in ENT,
                along with information on why they are done, when to undergo
                them, how they are performed, and what to expect during the
                procedures:

                <strong>
                  <u>Why:</u>
                </strong>{" "}
                Nasal endoscopy is performed to evaluate the nasal cavity,
                sinuses, and nasopharynx for conditions such as chronic
                sinusitis, nasal polyps, deviated septum, tumors, and nasal
                obstruction.

                <strong>
                  <u>When:</u>
                </strong>{" "}
                It may be recommended when a patient presents with symptoms such
                as nasal congestion, facial pain or pressure, recurrent sinus
                infections, or nasal bleeding.
              </p>
              <p className="wax-intro-text">
                <strong>
                  <u>How:</u>
                </strong>{" "}
                A thin, flexible or rigid endoscope is inserted through one of
                the nostrils and advanced into the nasal passages. The E.N.T.
                Specialist examines the nasal anatomy and may take biopsies or
                perform other interventions as needed.

                  <u>What to Expect:</u>
                </strong>{" "}
                Patients may experience slight discomfort or pressure during the
                procedure, but it is generally well tolerated. Nasal sprays or
                topical anesthesia may be used to minimize discomfort. The
                procedure is usually brief and performed on an outpatient basis.

                Laryngoscopy allows visualization of the larynx (voice box) and
                vocal cords to assess for conditions such as voice disorders,
                vocal cord paralysis, laryngeal cancer, and laryngopharyngeal

                Laryngoscopy can be performed using a flexible or rigid
                endoscope inserted through the mouth (transoral) or nose
                (transnasal). The physician examines the laryngeal structures,
                vocal cord function, and mucosal abnormalities.

                Patients may be given a local anesthetic spray to numb the
                throat before the procedure. Transnasal laryngoscopy is often
                well tolerated, while transoral laryngoscopy may cause gagging
                or discomfort. The procedure is typically performed in the opd
                setting.

                Otoscopy is used to visualize the external auditory canal,

                  affecting the ear, nose, and throat. They are typically safe,

                  accurate assessments and guiding appropriate treatment
                  strategies. Patients should discuss the specifics of each
                  procedure with their ENT specialist and address any concerns
